This opensouce textbook aims to revolutionize Modern Physis education by integrating computer programing and computational thinking. Through briding the gap between concepts and interactive visualization, we power the stdents to develop the essential computational skills need to excel in the 21<sup>st</sup>-century physics workforce.

Modern physics, while conceptually rich, often presents challenges for students in connecting abstract ideas to real-world phenomena. To address this, our e-textbook provides an interactive learning environment where students can directly apply programming concepts to solve physics problems. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of complex topics and cultivates a problem-solving mindset.

Traditional textbooks face limitations when incorporating programming, such as difficulties in accessing coding environments while solving physics problems. To address this, our electronic textbook allows students to develop and implement code directly within the text as they work through the concepts.

This textbook serves as a comprehensive guide for educators and students to blend computational thinking and programming skills with the study of modern physics. By merging computer programming with traditional physics education, we aim to cultivate a new generation of physics professionals capable of tackling complex problems and driving innovation. This integration empowers students to explore the frontiers of physics and contribute to scientific advancements in the digital age.
