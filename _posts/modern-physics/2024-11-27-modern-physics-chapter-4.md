In previous chapters, we've explored the atomic composition of matter and the particle-like behavior of photons. A natural question arises: if photons can exhibit particle-like properties, could particles, like electrons, also display wave-like behavior? To delve into this intriguing possibility, we'll examine de Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves and its experimental verification. Furthermore, we'll extend our discussion to incorporate wave mechanics and the uncertainty principle as foundational concepts of quantum theory. 

## 4.1 Introduction


## 4.2 Bohr's Theory
In the previous chapter, we have learned  that Bohr's had a biggest contribution to quantum principle. However, his theory has few limitations which are:

* Although his theory explains successfully explain the hydrogen spectrum, it could not accurately calculate the spectrum of larger atoms. His theory works for only hydrogen like atoms such as $$He^+$$, $$Li^{2+}$$ etc. 
* It failed explain why the intensity of spectral lines were not all equal. Here, some of the lines are favored more than others.
* It did not explain the observed hyperfine lines.
* Emission spectrum was split with in a magnetic field  (Zeeman effect) and Bohr's model did not explain.
* Although Bohr state that electrons were in stationary states, by he could not explain why it is.	
* It failed to provide  an  equation of motion governing  the time development of atomic system starting from some initial state. 


Bohr overemphasized  the particle nature of matter and  he could not explain the newly developed the wave-particle duality of light or interference. The Bohr's theory  is a good foundation for quantum physics, but it require significant improvements. 


$$\begin{equation*}
 	E = h f
\end{equation*}$$

where $$h$$ is Plank's constant and  total relativistic energy of the object (or photon)

$$\begin{equation*}
	\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\end{equation*}$$

where $$p$$ is the relativistic  momentum. 

In many cases it is more convenient  to express in term of **wave number** and **angular  frequency**, it defines as

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
k &=& \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \\
 \omega &=&  \frac{2 \pi}{T} = 2 \pi f
\end{eqnarray*} $$

With this  we may  write the preceding wave-particle  relationships as

$$\begin{eqnarray*}	
		p &=& \frac{h}{\lambda} = \left(\frac{h}{2 \pi}\right) \left(\frac{2\pi }{\lambda}\right) =   \hbar k  \\
		  E &=& h f  =\left(\frac{h}{2 \pi}\right) \left( 2 \pi f \right) = \hbar \omega
\end{eqnarray*}$$
