This chapter explores the particle-like nature of light, delving into groundbreaking experiments that revolutionized our understanding of quantum mechanics. We will examine Planck's blackbody radiation law, which introduced the concept of quantized energy, and the photoelectric effect, providing compelling evidence for the particle nature of light, known as photons. Additionally, we will delve into the production of X-rays, Compton scattering, and the gravitational influence on photons, further solidifying our comprehension of light's quantum behavior.

## 3.1 Introduction
One of key milestone in physics was the development of classical electromagnetism. James Clerk Maxwell unified the previously separate fields of electricity and magnetism, fomulating his famous **Maxwell's equations** in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.hese equations mathematically describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and established that light is an electromagnetic wave. This discovery not only unified physical phenomena but also laid the foundation for modern technologies such as radio, radar, and telecommunications.


While classical physics, including Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetism, provided a robust framework for understanding the macroscopic world, it proved inadequate for explaining the behavior of the microscopic world, such as the interactions within atoms and molecules. These limitations became apparent at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, as experimental observations began to diverge from classical predictions.
 
Contrary to a common misconception, the Quantum Revolution, which deeply transformed physics, did not originate with special relativity or Maxwell's theory but began with Max Planck's work on black-body radiation in 1900. Planck introduced the radical concept of energy quantization, proposing that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called **quanta**. 
This marked a fundamental departure from classical physics, resolving the "*ultraviolet catastrophe*" that classical theories could not explain.

Building upon Planck's groundbreaking insight, Albert Einstein extended the concept of quantization to light in 1905, postulating that light energy exists in discrete packets called photons. Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect provided compelling evidence for the particle-like nature of light and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. This revolutionary idea challenged the classical wave theory of light and established a dual wave-particle nature.

The subsequent development of quantum mechanics, rooted in the pioneering contributions of Planck and Einstein, fundamentally transformed our understanding of the physical universe. Quantum mechanics has since enabled scientists to explain a wide range of phenomena, from the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules to the properties of light and matter, catalyzing advancements in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and information technology.

## 3.2 Light: an Eletromagnetic Wave
Maxwell's theory predicts that the  radiated waves (EM) would  behave  in every way like light.  EM wave should exhibit the wave-like characteristics of light. So, one would expect the following properties of EM waves: reflection (by metal mirrors), refraction (in dielectrics like glass), polarization and interference, travel (outward from the  wire) through a vacuum with a speed of light $$(3.0 \times 10^8 m/s)$$.

Unfortunately (till now), a direct experimental  verification of Maxwell's hypothesis is impossible because attainable highest  electric frequencies is about  $10^9$ Hz that is un-measurable directly. For example, the  visible light is possess a frequency a million times higher than the {\color{blue} electric frequencies (300 nm to 800 nm = $10^{15}$ Hz to 3.75 $\times 10^{14}$ Hz).}

After a series of brilliant and exhaustive experiments, Heinrich Hertz showed that the Maxwell's hypothesis of EM waves is correct in 1887. The experimental setup is shown in Figure and that an oscillating characteristic of light except the same wavelength as light.

In 1883, Hertz became a lecture in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel and 2 years later became a professor of physics at Karlsruhe Polytechnic. 

In the Hertz's experiment, high frequency  was created by  applying pulse of high voltage, which caused a spark  to jump the gap and created high frequency ($5\times 10^8$ Hz) (see Figure~\ref{fig:hertz_exp}). Using a simple loop antenna receiver, the radiation from  spark gap oscillator is detected, even at distances of several hundred meters. He showed that detect wavelength is about 60 cm, which is $5 \times 10^8 $ Hz.

In addition, {\color{blue}Hertz also showed  that EM waves could be reflected, refracted, focused, polarized, and interfered.} He was able convince the physicists in that period that the radio wave (Hertzian waves) and light waves are the same. Furthermore, { \color{blue}Pieter Zeeman, a Dutch physicist, discover that  a strong magnetic field  changes the frequency  of the light emitted  by a glowing gas in 1896}.  Those experimental evidence was an {\color{blue}impressive victory for Maxwell} and Maxwell's equations which correctly predicted. As a result, {\color{blue}the classical model for light emission was popular in that time}, the idea spread like wildfire.

However, the classical model of light emission failed to explain the blackbody radiation which was another puzzle where the physicists were struggled to explain in 1900's. In the following section, we will learn about the blackbody radiation.
