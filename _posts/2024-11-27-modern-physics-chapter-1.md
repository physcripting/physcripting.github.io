This chapter serves as a guide to outline the key events and concepts in the journey towards modern physics. We belive the significance of comprehending these events before delving into modern physics. Additionally, exploring the history behind these events can help us grasp the evolution, not just the outcomes. However, our review doesn't replace the fundamentals knowledge covered in an introductory physics course. We assume  yo are familiar with basic concepts such as vectors, partial derivatives, and integration. This review primarily focuses on essential classical mechanics, particularly classical relativity, serving as a stepping stone for the following chapter. The content presented here is intentionally concise, intended as a quick refresher. For a more in-depth understanding, we encourage revisiting the materials from the introductory physics courses.

## 1.1 Introduction
The physics has a long and fascinating histroy with many significant
 discoveries and milestones along the way. Among the most notable 
 milestones before modern physiccs (20<sup>th</sup> century), 
 classical mechanics emerged in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, primarily attribuated to Isaac Newton, and further enriched by contributions from various mathematicisian and physicist, including Johannes Kepler, Leonhard Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange,  and others. This theory laid the groundwork for comprehending the motion of objects at macroscopic scales and the laws that govern them. Classical physics remains a vital branch of physics. Another important milestone was the development of thermodynamics in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, which helped us understand the relationship between heat, energy, and the principles of entropy.

 Finally, the revelation of electromagnetism in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
 century. These milestones paved the way for modern physics. The 
 subsequent timeline chart highlisths several major milestones 
 pre-modern physics.
