This chapter serves as a guide to outline the key events and concepts in the journey towards modern physics. We belive the significance of comprehending these events before delving into modern physics. Additionally, exploring the history behind these events can help us grasp the evolution, not just the outcomes. However, our review doesn't replace the fundamentals knowledge covered in an introductory physics course. We assume  yo are familiar with basic concepts such as vectors, partial derivatives, and integration. This review primarily focuses on essential classical mechanics, particularly classical relativity, serving as a stepping stone for the following chapter. The content presented here is intentionally concise, intended as a quick refresher. For a more in-depth understanding, we encourage revisiting the materials from the introductory physics courses.

## 1.1 Introduction
The physics has a long and fascinating histroy with many significant
 discoveries and milestones along the way. Among the most notable 
 milestones before modern physiccs (20<sup>th</sup> century), 
 classical mechanics emerged in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, primarily attribuated to Isaac Newton, and further enriched by contributions from various mathematicisian and physicist, including Johannes Kepler, Leonhard Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange,  and others. This theory laid the groundwork for comprehending the motion of objects at macroscopic scales and the laws that govern them. Classical physics remains a vital branch of physics. Another important milestone was the development of thermodynamics in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, which helped us understand the relationship between heat, energy, and the principles of entropy.

 Finally, the revelation of electromagnetism in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
 century. These milestones paved the way for modern physics. The 
 subsequent timeline chart highlisths several major milestones 
 pre-modern physics.

		<li>
			<div class="time">1564-1642</div>
			<hh3>Galileo Galile</hh3>
			<p> An Italian scholar, studied nature, stars, and mathematics. He is widely regarded as a foundational figure in the advancement of physics. Thanks to his experiments and methods,which have had a profound impact on our understanding of the laws governing the physical world. He is best known for his observations with a telescope,  which unveiled groundbreaking astronomical discoveries, including Jupiter's  moons and Venus's phases. \(\textbf{Galileo}\) is  one of the most important figures in the history of science.</p>

		<li>
			<div class="time">1642-1727</div>
			<hh3>Sir Isaac Newton</hh3>
			<p> An English scholar made groundbreaking contributions to science, particularly in physics and mathematics. He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics. Additionally, he made significant advancements in calculus, optics, and the study of light and color. His work revolutionized scientific thought, profoundly influencing various fields for centuries to come. Beyond Newtonian mechanics, numerous alternative formulations, including Lagrangian dynamics, Hamilton’s formulation, and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, have been developed to describe the complexities of motion, expanding upon his foundational work .</p>

			<div class="time">1785</div>
			<hh3>Coulomb's Law</hh3> 
			<p> It describes the electrostatic force between charged particles, \( F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} \). It is named after the French physicist \(\textbf{Charles-Augustin de Coulomb}\) (1736-1806), who first formulated the law in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1811</div>
			<hh3>Avodgadro's law </hh3> 
			<p> \(\textbf{Amedeo Avogadro}\) (1776-1856)suggested that equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain an equal number of molecules, regardless of the type of gas. The term "Avogadro number" was later proposed by the French physicist \(\textbf{Jean Perrin}\) to honor Avogadro's contributions to the understanding of the molecular nature of gases. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1823</div>
			<hh3> Ampère's Law </hh3>
			<p> \(\textbf{André-Marie Ampère}\) (1775-1836), a French physicist and mathematician, related the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop, which is called Ampère's Law:	\( \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = \mu_0 \iint_S \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}\).  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1824</div>
			<hh3> Carnot's Theorem </hh3> 
			<p> French Military engineer and physicist \(\textbf{Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot}\) (1796-1832) developed the inaugural theory on the maximum efficiency of heat engines, famously known as Carnot's theorem: any heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs is inherently less efficient than a Carnot heat engine functioning between the same reservoirs.  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1831</div>
			<hh3>Faraday's Law </hh3> 
			<p> This law\( \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d \phi_B}{dt}\), stating that the electromotive force  (\( \mathcal{E}\)) induced in a circuit is equal to the negative rate of changes of magnetic flux (\(\phi_B\)) through the circuit. It was independently discovered by \(\textbf{Michael Faraday} \)(1791-1867) in 1831 and \(\textbf{Joseph Henry}\) (1797-1878) in 1832. However, it was Michael Faraday who first published the results. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1835</div>
			<hh3>Gauss's Law </hh3> 
			<p> It relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface, \( \oint (\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}) = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0} \).  The law is named after the German mathematician and physicist \(\textbf{Carl Friedrich Gauss}\) (1777–1855), who formulated it.  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1851</div>
			<hh3>Law of thermodynamics</hh3> 
			<p> The formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics and the concept of absolute zero temperature are indeed attributed to several scientists, but Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) contributed significantly to the development and understanding of these principles. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1864</div>
			<hh3>Classical Electromagnetism</hh3> 
			<p> James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) revolutionized the understanding of electricity and magnetism by formulating a set of four fundamental partial differential equations. These equations, known as Maxwell's Equations, describe how electric and magnetic fields interact with matter. His pioneering work not only established that light behaves as an electromagnetic wave but also introduced the idea that these waves travel uniformly. Maxwell's contributions laid the groundwork for a significant part of both modern physics and engineering. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="time">1895</div>
			<hh3>Maxwell-Boltzmann Velocity Distribution</hh3> 
			<p>It, defining the spread of speeds within a gas at a given temperature, was formulated through the collaboration of Scottish mathematical physicist \(\textbf{James Clerk Maxwell}\) (1831-1879) and Austrian physicist and philosopher \(\textbf{Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann}\) (1844-1906). This distribution illustrates how the velocities of gas particles vary within a gas sample, providing crucial insights into statistical mechanics and the behavior of gases at different temperatures.</p>

While classical physics remains highly accurate and applicable in most everyday scenarios and technologies, it encounters limitations in extreme conditions, such as very high speeds (nearing the speed of light, necessitating special relativity) and exceedingly small scales (atomic or subatomic levels, necessitating quantum mechanics). These limitations prompted the development of modern physics, which emerged in the 20<sup>th</sup> century and broadened our comprehension of the physical world beyond classical physics' scope. Although its scope narrows in these extreme conditions, classical mechanics still stands as a vital foundation for comprehending the physical world, paving the way for more advanced branches of physics.
