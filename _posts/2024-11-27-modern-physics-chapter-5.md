In the previous chapters, we have learned that the matter forms by atoms and also particle nature of photons. The question arises if  photons behave like particle, wave nature of particles is possible. To learn about this, we will discuss the de Brogile's hypothesis of wave nature of particles and its experimental evidence.  In addition, we extend our discussion to describe using wave theory and uncertainty principle to introduce quantum theory. 


## 5.1 Introduction
Concept of particles and waves  is fundamentally different. Newtonian (classical) mechanics consider, we consider  energy of particle is confined into small space and can describe the exact location. On the other hand, waves undergo diffraction and interference and these behavior cannot explain with Newtonian mechanics of  particles. Energy of wave is distributed throughout space in its wave-fronts. In addition, exact location of waves is not possible to describe.  

Classical and Quantum physics has clear distinction. In quantum physics, the particle need to obey the wave nature sometimes where  quantum system  is sometimes called  ``wave mechanics".  As we learn quantum physics, we will learn the probability and average of repetitions of a measurement and statistical behavior  of a system are necessary to understand the quantum behavior.

In this chapter we will extend our knowledge to understand motion and interaction of subatomic particles through wave nature of particles. 

## 5.2 De Brogile Wavelenght and Matter 
In the previous chapter, we have learned  that Bohr's had a biggest contribution to quantum principle. However, his theory has few limitations which are:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Although his theory explains successfully explain the hydrogen spectrum, it could not accurately calculate the spectrum of larger atoms. His theory works for only hydrogen like atoms such as $He^+$, $Li^2+$ etc. 
	\item  It failed explain why the intensity of spectral lines were not all equal. Here, some of the lines are favored more than others.
	\item  It did not explain the observed hyperfine lines.
	\item  Emission spectrum was split with in a magnetic field  (Zeeman effect) and Bohr's model did not explain.
	\item  Although Bohr state that electrons were in stationary states, by he could not explain why it is.	
	\item It failed to provide  an  equation of motion governing  the time development of atomic system starting from some initial state. 
\end{enumerate}
Bohr overemphasized  the particle nature of matter and  he could not explain the newly developed the wave-particle duality of light or interference. The Bohr's theory  is a good foundation for quantum physics, but it require significant improvements. 

We have learned that E.M waves (light) sometime behaves  like  particles (quanta) and sometimes behave like waves. The big question, what is the reality? Is this duality  particular to EM radiation or? or is it for all matter?

\textbf{Louis de Broglie (1924)} proposed that all moving objects have wave properties. In his dissertation, he postulate "\textbf{Because photons have wave and particle characteristic, perhaps all forms of matter have wave as well as  particle properties.}

This was experimentally verified later. This idea  is the key for the development of modern theory called  \textbf{Quantum Mechanics} by Heisenberg, Schroedinger, Born, Paul, Dirac and so on.

Let's recall the  energy of photon,
\begin{equation*}
 	E = h f\ \ \Rightarrow 	f= \frac{E}{h}
\end{equation*}
where $h$ is Plank's constant and  total relativistic energy of the object (or photon) 
\begin{equation*}
	\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\end{equation*}
where $p$ is the relativistic  momentum. 

In many cases it is more convenient  to express in term of \textbf{wave number} and \textbf{angular  frequency}, it defines as
\begin{eqnarray*}
k &=& \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \\
 \omega &=&  \frac{2 \pi}{T} = 2 \pi f
\end{eqnarray*} 
With this  we may  write the preceding wave-particle  relationships as
\begin{eqnarray*}	
		p &=& \frac{h}{\lambda} = \left(\frac{h}{2 \pi}\right) \left(\frac{2\pi }{\lambda}\right) =   \hbar k  \\
		  E &=& h f  =\left(\frac{h}{2 \pi}\right) \left( 2 \pi f \right) = \hbar \omega
\end{eqnarray*}

De Broglie stated, lacking experimental support for his hypothesis,
Louis de Brogile proposed that all moving object obey the same rule. 
\begin{equation*}
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{m v}
\end{equation*}
where $ m = \frac{m_o}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

From above equation, we can see that greater  the momentum of the object smaller  the wavelength. If a particle has the wavelength it should exhibit  wave  properties like interference. Later, it has been observed experimentally. 

Let's recall relativistic momentum from special relativity
\begin{equation*}
		p = \gamma m_0 v
\end{equation*}
and relativistic energy is
\begin{equation*}
		E^2 =  p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 = \gamma^2 m^2 c^4
\end{equation*}

If an object appears "wavelike", it should exhibit interference or diffraction. For both  interference or diffraction, it is required  that the scattering objectors and apertures need to almost  the same size as the wavelength. Before proceed scattering experiment,  let's look at example to understand the de Brogile wavelength in our life:
