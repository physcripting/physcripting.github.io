Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity revolutionized our understanding of the universe. This groundbreaking concept challenged and redefined our intuitive notions of space, time, and motion, initiating a new era in physics. Special relativity governs phenomena involving objects or reference frames moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, approximately $$3\times 10^8 \ m/s$$, relative to one another.  
Our everyday experiences occur at speeds far below this cosmic speed limit. Even spacecraft, which travel at impressive speeds around ~$$25,000\ mi/h  (\approx 1.1 \times 10^4 m/s)$$, only reach a tiny fraction of the speed of light. Because of our lack of direct experience with such high velocities, we often struggle to grasp the counterintuitive principles of special realtivity. 
However, through conceptual understanding and theoretical exploration, we can imagine a world where time and distance are not absolute, and where nothing can exceed the speed of light. This chapter will briefly introduce the concepts and theories of this revolutionary theory.

## 2.1 Introduction
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of electromagnetism. In the 1860s, he unified electricity, magnetism, and  into a single theoretical framework. One of the remarkable implications through this unification was a theoretical prediction for the speed of light in a vacuum: 

\begin{equation}
    c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}
\end{equation}

where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, $$\mu_0 $$ is permeability of free space ($$~ 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N/A^2$$ ) and $$\epsilon_0$$ is permittivity of free space ($$ ~  = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \ C^2/N.m^2 $$).

In the 19<sup>th</sup>, physicists believed that electromagnetic wave including light, required a medium for propagation like other waves. This hypothetical medium was called the "luminiferous ether," thought to permeate all of space, including in vacuum. Particularly, the speed of light was assumed to be constant relative to this ether frame, leading scientist to believed that ether was delicate enought to allow celestial bodies such as  planets to pass through it freely.
