## 13.1 Introduction
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in computational chemistry, biophysics, and materials science by enabling researchers to model atomic and molecular interactions over time. These simulations are widely used for studying protein-ligand interactions, polymers, nucleic acids, and other complex biomolecular systems.
