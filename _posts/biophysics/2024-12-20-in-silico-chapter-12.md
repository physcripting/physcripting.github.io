Understanding the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules is essential for advancing our knowledge in diverse fields—from drug discovery to the computational modeling of complex biological processes.  In this chapter, we introduce UCSF ChimeraX, a state-of-the-art visualization tool that transforms how researchers explore and analyze biomolecular structures.

## 1.1 Introduction
UCSF ChimeraX (commonly referred to as ChimeraX) is the next-generation molecular visualization program developed by the UCSF Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics (RBVI). It enables interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures, density maps, molecular dynamics trajectories, and sequence alignments. ChimeraX is the successor to UCSF Chimera, which is no longer actively developed following the conclusion of its funding in 2016.

One of the key strengths of ChimeraX is its interoperability with a variety of computational tools, making it an invaluable resource for diverse applications. For example:
* **MODELLER** – Enables comparative protein structure modeling.
* **AlphaFold** – Provides deep-learning-based protein structure prediction.
* **AutoDock (ViewDockX)** –  Facilitates molecular docking and ligand-binding analysis.

In this chapter, we will explore how to leverage ChimeraX's advanced functionalities to gain insights into biomolecular structures and dynamics, and and prepare structures for molecular dynamics simulations, furthering our understanding of biological processes at the molecular level.

## 1.2 Overview of ChmieraX 
Figure-1 shows the basic overview of ChimeraX, which is a highly customizable interface, allowing you to arrange and configure these elements to suit your preferences. The ChimeraX front window primarily consists of:

</figure>

3D Graphics Window: This is the central area where you visualize and interact with 3D molecular structures.
* **Toolbars**: Located at the top, these provide quick access to common commands and tools.
* **Panels**: These are detachable windows that offer various functionalities:
    * **Model Panel**: Displays a list of loaded models and allows for various operations on them.
    * **Command Line**: Enables you to execute commands directly.
    * **Other panels**: Depending on your needs, you might have panels for tools like sequence viewer, surface generation, volume visualization, and more. For example, clicking serquence botton will bring a new window panel below the Model Panel.

    Panels can be easily shown, hidden, and repositioned. They can also be detached (undocked) from the main window and subsequently reinserted (docked). To manage panels:
    * **Dismiss a Panel**: Click the "x" button on its title bar (if docked) or the generic close-window button (if undocked).
    * **Show a Hidden Panel**: Check its name in the bottom section of the Tools menu or in the context menu of any docked panel's title bar.
    * **Undock a Panel**: Click the "rectangles" button on its title bar or drag/double-click its title bar.
    * **Redock a Panel**: Drag or double-click its title bar to insert it back into the main window.
    * **Tab Panels**: Drag a panel to the same area as another to create a tabbed set; clicking a tab brings the corresponding panel to the front.

### 1.2.1 Basic Mouse Controls
In ChimeraX, the basic mouse controls for interacting with molecular structures and 3D visualizations are:
* Hover the mouse over atoms for a second, box will appear says: /A BTN 300 S1 (chain A, molecule code BTN, atom code #300, sulfur #1)
* **Rotation, Translation, and Zooming**
    * Left Mouse Button (Click & Drag) → Rotate the structure
    * Middle Mouse Button (Click & Drag) → Move (translate) the structure
    * Right Mouse Button (Click & Drag) OR Scroll Wheel → Zoom in/out
* **Selection and Picking**
    * Ctrl + Left Click → Select an atom, residue, or molecular component
    * Ctrl + Shift + Left Click → Select multiple items
    * Double Left Click on an Object → Center and zoom in on that object
* Alternative Mouse Modes (for Specific Tools)
    * Alt + Left Click & Drag → Slab clipping (adjust depth of view)
    * Shift + Right Click & Drag → Adjust threshold levels in volume data
    * Ctrl + Mouse Scroll → Adjust contour levels for density maps

We can customize mouse actions via **Tools → General → Mouse Modes**, allowing you to assign different functions to each mouse button.

### 1.2.2 Basic Control 
In this section, we will explore the basic controls for manipulating proteins in ChimeraX, using **Human Deoxyhemoglobin** (**PDB: 2HHB**) as our model structure. The structure consists of **four chains** (Alpha chains: Labeled A and C; Beta chains: Labeled B and D) and **Ligands** (Non-Protein Compounds): Heme group (HEM) and Phosphate ion.

Get comfortable with the mouse controls and buttons in ChimeraX, including those found under the "Home," "Molecule Display," and other menus. Practice essential operations such as rotation, translation, zooming, and selection (picking). For more details, refer to section 1.2.1, "Basic Mouse Control."

> **Note**: If the protein does not contain nucleotides, then nucleoside-related functions will not work in ChimeraX.

### 1.3.2 Aligning Structure
In this section, we will explore how to compare multiple protein structures through structural alignment. Using ChimeraX’s MatchMaker tool, we will learn how to align two or more protein structures based on sequence and structural similarity. This process allows us to analyze conserved regions, structural differences, and evolutionary relationships. Additionally, we will examine sequence alignments to gain insights into functional similarities between proteins. By the end of this section, you will have a clear understanding of how to perform structural superimposition and sequence comparisons in ChimeraX. 

The following steps describe the alignment of the human deoxyhemoglobin (PDB ID: 2HHB) chain D with the oxymyoglobin (PDB ID: 1MBO) structure. The alignment will be colored based on the $$\alpha$$ carbon RMSD values. The output using ChimeraX is shown Figure 6.

### 1.4.2 Hydrogen Bond and Distance Analysis
We will investigate the structure of the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme CrtM, a promising drug target due to its involvement in the biosynthesis of the virulence factor staphyloxanthin.  Staphyloxanthin, responsible for the bacterium's characteristic golden color, protects S. aureus from host immune attack.  Our study will compare different structural conformations of CrtM.
* `open 3w7f`
* `del #1/b` (or `delete #1/b`)
* `view ligand` – Focus the view on the ligand residues 
* `label ligand` – Label residue
* `label height 1.0` – Change label height to 1.0 A, default 0.7A, 
* `del solvent` – remove solvent to simplify analysis.
* `label @@display` -label the residues with sidechains, @@display refers to an attribute at the atom level called "display," which indicates whether the atom is shown in the display area. In essence, the command is instructing to label all residues with atoms that are displayed.

In this model, farnesyl thiopyrophosphate (FPS) is shown with three magnesium ions (green spheres) that neutralize the phosphate charges.  Coordination bonds between FPS, water, and the protein are depicted as dashed purple lines.  Non-covalent interactions are represented as pseudobonds; hovering over these reveals the participating atoms and bond lengths.

* `Sel :21`  -select residue Serine (Ser, S) 21
* `view sel`
* `Ctrl-click to pick oxygen of Ser 21`
* `Shift-Ctrl-doubleclick on the nearest phosphate oxygen`
* `Tools → Structure Analysis → Distance`  (click create to show the distance between the selection)
* `distance #1:21@OG #1:302@O1B` : Prvious steps in command lines
* `distance :248@OH :302@O1B`

Distance measurements are displayed as yellow dashed lines. These distances appear to match hydrogen bonds. Instead of manually measuring many distances and recalling specific hydrogen-bonding distances for different atom types, you can simply use the hbonds command or the H-Bonds tool.
* `sel :FPS` – first select the FPS resides to limit H-bond search (or menu:  `Select → Residues →FPS`
* `view sel`
* `hbonds sel restrict cross reveal true log true` - Find H-bonds with one end selected. 
* Or `Tools→ Structure Analysis → H-Bonds` 
* `select to Reveal atoms of H-bonding residues`,
* `Limit by selection: with exactly one end selected, and Log`, other settings default. 

<figure class="half-width">

	<figcaption>Hydrogen and Distance Analysis</figcaption>
</figure>

The hydrogen bonds are represented by light blue dashed lines. The two measured distances confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonding. More information can be found in the Log. if you would like to remove hydrogen bonds and distance then: 
* `hide hbonds`  or `~hbonds` - Hide H-bonds
* `~distance` – Remove the distance measurements

### 1.4.3 Clashes and Contacts
- **Clashes** refer to unfavorable interactions occurring when atoms are too close together, often termed as close contacts. 
- **Contacts** encompass various direct interactions, both polar and nonpolar, favorable and unfavorable, which include **clashes**.
* `open 3w7f`
* `del #1/b`
* `sel #1:FPS`
* `color sel gray`
* `color sel byelement`
* `contacts sel restrict cross reveal t log t select t` – identifying contacts of selected residues (FPS)
*  Or `Tools → Structure Analysis → Contacts`.
* `Limit by selction with at least one end selected`

The log provides a list of atom-atom contacts, ordered by decreasing van der Waals (vdW) overlap.  The degree of overlap is indicated by a numerical value: positive values denote intersecting vdW spheres, zero indicates touching spheres, and negative values indicate separated spheres.  A default setting includes slightly separated spheres as contacts.  Interatomic distances are also reported.

* `~contacts` – remove the contact pseudobonds
* `~label`- remove the labels

The Log provides detailed information about each atomic contact, but sometimes it's more convenient to have a simpler list of interacting residues instead. To start, d.
* `info residues sel` -list the selected residues in the  log. You can see Serine (Ser, S) 21, Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) 248, and several others in the list.
* `~sel`- deselect the selection.

### 1.4.4 Angles, Rotamers,and Clashes
We will continue work on the  **3w7f**
* `sel clear` – clear the selection.
* `view :248`   - focus the view on Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) 248
* `select: 248`  - select the whole residue Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) 248 or  `Ctrl-click to select any atom in Tyr 248`, then press the up arrow key on the keyboard to promote the selection to the whole residue
* `Tool show clashes` – start clashes to setup  class checking and rotat the sidechain interactively. Or `Tools → Structure Analysis → Clashes`
* `clashes sel restrict cross reveal t continuous t` – restrict the option to limit by selection, revel atoms, frequency of checking to continuously  Or it can be done using dialog box.
* `Tools → Strctuure Analysis → Clashes`: In the Clashes dialog, **keep most options as defaults**, except:
    * Turn on the option to `Limit by selection`, set to: `with exactly one end selected`

As reported in the Log, <u> no clashes with Tyr 248 </u> are found in its initial position

As reported in the Log, no clashes with Tyr 248 are found in its initial position
Let’s measure the sidechain $$χ_1$$ and $$χ_2$$ angles of Tyr 248.
* `torsion :248@n, ca, cb, cg` – measuring respect to α carbon, β carbon, and γ carbon 
* `torsion :248@ ca, cb, cg, cd1`

The Log reports angles $$χ_1$$ and $$χ_2$$ as $$106.801^o$$ and -$$142.054^o$$, respectively.

The torsion command sets the angle defined by the four specified atoms to angle in degrees, or if angle is omitted, reports the current value in the Log. A centroid or marker can be specified as an atom. For changing the angle, the two middle atoms must be covalently bonded to one another.
* `set Right Mouse to "Bond Rotation"`

With the assigned button, click on the Tyr 248 CA-CB bond (closest to the ribbon) and drag to change chi1 interactively, or on the CB-CG bond (the next one out, adjacent to the ring) to change chi2. Any clashes are shown as bright purple pseudobonds and updated automatically as the bond is rotated.

Close the Clashes dialog. If clash pseudobonds are still shown, remove them
* `~clashes` – To hide the clashes display
* `torsion :248@n,ca,cb,cg -106.801` – restoring the angle back
* `torsion :248@ca,cb,cg,cd1 -142.054` -restoring the angle back

Next, we will compare the conformation of Tyr 248 in the structure to tyrosine rotamers from a library. With Tyr 248 still selected (if not, Ctrl-click it), start the Rotamers tool:
