Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins, which are essential for the structure and function of all living organisms. This chapter provides an overview of the 20 standard amino acids, also known as common amino acids, which serve as the core components of proteins. By linking together in various sequences, these 20 amino acids can form an immense variety of polypeptides, giving rise to the diverse proteins necessary for biological processes.
